# Welcome
feedler help you publish news from one or more sources on one or more platforms, automatically, easily and controlled.

:::caution Migration warning

We are migrating the old documentation to this Doc Hub. Some pages may not be full available.

:::

## How to start
To automate a publication process, you need to create at least a [Workflow](workflow). In this
documentation we will show you how to add a channel, feed and connect them to a
new workflow.

First, login to [feedler.net](https://feedler.net) with your Telegram account, then:

1. Add a new channel (Telegram, Discord, ...)
2. Add a new feed (RSS, Atom, Youtube, Twitch, TikTok, ...)
3. Create and publish a new workflow

Continue to the next section to learn how to add your first channel.
