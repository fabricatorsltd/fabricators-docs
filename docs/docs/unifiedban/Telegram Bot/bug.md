Did you find a bug?

Help us improve our services, report bugs to our developers through the appropriate channels.

Before opening a new report, check if it has already been reported, this helps us to reduce the investigation time.

## Bug report
Before you begin, check that no one has [already reported](https://github.com/unified-ban/Terminal/issues?q=) the bug.

Then proceed by creating a [new Issue](https://github.com/unified-ban/Terminal/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=[BUG]+-+title) 
in the repository.

A new report must have the following structure:

```bash
**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
```

Reports that do not comply with the above structure can be considered invalid and **may be closed** by our developers.

## Response and resolution times
Response times are usually short but can be extended based on the priority of the tasks already open.

We ask you not to comment further on the reports to receive an answer. Each issue is real time reported to our developers.

The priority of the reports is assigned by the developers themselves. Under each report there are ** emojis **, to 
give greater importance to the report it is possible to invite people with the same problem to participate by adding 
frone or more emojis.
