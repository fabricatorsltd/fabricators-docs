unified/ban comes with a fully integrated online Dashboard. Here you can manage the bot settings and behavior.

> We also provide a simple and fully **Anonymous Analytics** based on the administrators issued commands and chat 
>events (ban, kick, spam, scam â€¦).

To enable the dashboard you must first have correctly [configured](setup#administration) the bot in at least one group.

Next, open the [Dashboard](https://unifiedban.solutions) in your Web Browser and click on `Dashboard` on the top right 
of the page, then Sign In with your Telegram account (you must use an administrator account in your group). After login 
you should see your profile picture and below that, the **Dashboard** link. 

Once you enter the Dashboard, you will find yourself in front of a summary screen. Here you can read the bot status, 
some statistics and the latest updates (we recommend reading these in our [News channel](https://t.me/unifiedban_news) 
for more details).

Click on **Groups** in the top menu, here you should see the list of your groups. Click on one of these to access the 
analytics, settings, logs, badwords, safenames and more.

> Each change is saved and synchronized with the bot in real time.
