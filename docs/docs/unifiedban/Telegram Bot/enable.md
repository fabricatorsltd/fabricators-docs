The Enable command is normally used by operators to manually enable a group (normally when for some reason it does 
not happen automatically).

Only unified/ban operators can use this command.

## Syntax

Just type `/enable` in the group:

```bash
/enable
```

## For developers

This command is defined in the file `/Bot/Command/Enable.cs`.

To disable a group we can use the `/disable` command:

```bash
/disable
```

This command is defined in the file `/Bot/Command/Disable.cs`.
